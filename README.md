# ROS REALITY

Hi, and welcome to ROS Reality, a virtual reality teleoperation interface for ROS enabled robots (we use a Baxter, but the code could easily be modified for any ROS robot). This readme contains all the information you need to get started.

## Overview

This package contains a Unity package that connects to ROS network over the internet and uses sensor data sent on ROS topics to populate a virtual reality scene. The sensors used are a Kinect v2, the wrist cameras of the robot, and the joint encoders of the robot.

## Dependencies

You will need to install Unity. We run 5.5, but 5.4 should work too.

## Running ROS Reality
